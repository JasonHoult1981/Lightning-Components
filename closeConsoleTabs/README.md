# closeConsoleTabs
This is a generic Lightning Component that can be used in a Page Layout or on a Utility Bar.

It will close any open tabs and sub-tabs in a console application.

It takes a single parameter: Close Pinned Tabs?

The default is false, which will leave any pinned tabs open.  If set to true, then all tabs will be closed.
